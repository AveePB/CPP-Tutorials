# Header files
These are files, that usually get included in the cpp files using **#include** statement. They store different declarations.

## Syntax
The header file consists of a few elements:
- preprocessor statement **#pragma once**: only include this file once;
- multiple declarations;
```
#pragma once
#include <string>

void sayHi(string student_name);
void addition(int num1, int num2);
```

## Include header
If we want to include the header file we use statement **#include "header-file-name"**. Angle brackets are used to import the liblaries **<>**.
```
#include <iostream> //includes lib
#include "basicfuncs.h" //includes header file
...
```
