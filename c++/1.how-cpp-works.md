# How does C++ work?

## Preprocessor Statements
In C++, the preprocessor directives are special commands that are used to instruct the preprocessor. It begins with a **'#'** symbol and tells the preprocessor to modify source code before compilation (e.g., ***#include***, ***#define***). 

## Entry Point
The standard specifies that the starting point for the C++ code is a **main** function. It's an int type function that doesn't have to return any value.
```
...

int main() {

    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
}

...
```

## Executable Files
**EXE** files are executable programs that run in Microsoft Windows. Such files contain data that Windows uses to recognize, read and run the program. This data is saved in a compile, binary format, sometimes called machine code.

### Creation Proccess:
- Modifying a **CPP** file by evaluating the preprocessor statements; 
- Each **CPP** file is compiled into the **OBJ** file;
- **OBJ** files are linked together in part of the process known as ***the linker***;
