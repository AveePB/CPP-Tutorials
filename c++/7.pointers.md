# Pointers
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address as its value.

A pointer variable points to a data type (like int or string) of the same type, and is created with the * operator. The address of the variable you're working with is assigned to the pointer
```
    ...
    int age = 18;
    int* agePtr = &age;
    ...
```

## Ampersand Operator &
We can get the memory address of a variable by using the & operator. Later, we might use it to initialize the pointer:
```
    ...
    string student = "Aysha";
    std::cout << &student << std::endl;
    ...
```

## Asterisk Operator *
We can get the value of the variable that is pointed by the pointer by using the * operator:
```
    ...
    string* studentPtr = &student;
    std::cout << *studentPtr << std::endl;
    ...
```
