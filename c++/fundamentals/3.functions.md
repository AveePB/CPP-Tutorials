# Functions
In C++, a function is a group of statements that is given a name, and which can be called from some point of the program. 

## Syntax
The most common syntax to define a function is:
```
    type name(parm1, parm2, ...) {
        statement();
        ...
    }
```
Where:
- **type**: is the type of the value returned by the function;
- ***name***: s the identifier by which the function can be called;
- **parm1**, **parm2** (as many as needed): Each parameter consists of a type followed by an identifier, with each parameter being separated from the next by a comma. Each parameter looks very much like a regular variable declaration (for example: int x), and in fact acts within the function as a regular variable which is local to the function.;

### Void function
It is a function, that doesn't return any value. It uses keyword **void** as the return type.
```
    void sayHello(string name) {
        std::cout << "Hello " << name << std::endl; 
    }
```
### Non-void function
This type of function is forced to use the **return** keyword to return a value.
```
    int addition(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
```
