# Loops
In Programming, sometimes there is a need to perform some operation more than once or (say) n number of times. Loops come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements.

## For loop
A For loop is a repetition control structure that allows us to write a loop that is executed a specific number of times. The loop enables us to perform n number of steps together in one line.
```
    ...
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cout << i << ' ';
    }
    ...
```
- **Initialization statement**: This statement gets executed only once, at the beginning of the for loop;
- **Condition**: This statement gets evaluated ahead of each execution of the loop body, and abort the execution if the given condition get false;
- **Iteration execution**: This statement gets executed after the loop body, ahead of the next condition evaluated;

## While loop
While loops are used in situations where we do not know the exact number of iterations of the loop beforehand. The loop execution is terminated on the basis of the test conditions.
```
    ...
    int i = 0;

    while (i < n) {
        std::cout << i << ' ';
        i++;
    }
    ...
```
- **Condition**: This statement gets evaluated ahead of each execution of the loop body, and abort the execution if the given condition get false;

## Do While loop
In Do-while loops also the loop execution is terminated on the basis of test conditions. The main difference between a do-while loop and the while loop is in the do-while loop the condition is tested at the end of the loop body;
```
    ...
    int i = 0;

    do {
        std::cout << i << ' ';
        i++;
    } while (i < n);
    ...
```
- **Condition**: This statement gets evaluated ahead of each execution of the loop body, and abort the execution if the given condition get false;
